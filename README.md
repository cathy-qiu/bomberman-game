:video_game: [Bomberman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomberman) is a classic game first released in 1987 by developer Hudson Soft. The gameplay featured a character walking around a top-down arena with impassable walls in a grid formation and bricks between them. 

The goal of the game is to navigate to the exit by breaking the bricks with bombs to cut a path while dodging or blowing up the monsters that were on the map too. Bomberman has went through many different interpretations with different gameplay features and goals. 

This version of Bomberman created is a two-player battle arena version. In order to win, players use different buttons on the same keyboard to trap and explode each other with their bombs. The players would load in on opposite sides of the arena and advance towards the center by destroying the destructible bricks to eventually fight in the middle.
